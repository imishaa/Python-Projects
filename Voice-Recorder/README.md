Recording audio is a fundamental aspect of various applications, from creating voice notes to developing sophisticated systems. This Python script provides a simple yet powerful voice recording utility using the sounddevice and scipy libraries.

## Installation
Before running the script, make sure to install the sounddevice module by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install sounddevice
```
- The sounddevice library is a cross-platform Python module designed for real-time audio input and output. It provides a simple interface for working with audio devices, making it a valuable tool for tasks such as recording and playing back audio.
- This will ensure that the necessary library is available for recording audio in the script.

## How to Use
- Run the script in a Python environment.
- Enter the desired recording duration in seconds when prompted.
- Provide a name for the recorded file (without extension).
- The script will record the voice, save it as a WAV file, and print a confirmation message.

## Note
- This script is a straightforward example of a voice recorder in Python. It captures stereo audio at a specified duration and saves it as a WAV file. For more advanced features, consider exploring additional libraries and functionalities.
- This script can serve as a foundation for integrating voice recording capabilities into your projects, applications, or systems.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance this script based on your specific use case and security requirements. Happy learning and coding!
