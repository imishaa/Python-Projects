## OTP Verification System
The OTP (One-Time Password) Verification System is a crucial component in ensuring secure and robust user authentication processes. This Python script serves as a basic example of OTP generation and verification using a simple email-based delivery mechanism. While this script provides a foundational understanding, it is important to note that for production-level systems, it is recommended to use dedicated libraries and services for enhanced security and reliability.

### Features of the Python OTP Verification Script:
- **Random OTP Generation:** The script generates a random 6-digit OTP to enhance security.

- **Email Delivery:** Utilizes the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send the OTP to the user's provided email address.

- **User Input Validation:** Prompts the user to enter the OTP and validates it against the generated OTP.

- **Maximum Attempts Limit:** Implements a maximum attempt limit to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

### Usage:
- **Generate OTP:** The script generates a random OTP and sends it to the specified email address.

- **User Verification:** The user enters the received OTP, and the script verifies it against the generated OTP.

- **Security Note:** For security reasons, the sender's Gmail ID and App Password have been removed. Users are encouraged to generate their App Passwords from Google settings for testing purposes.

### Quick Start:
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

- Run the script and follow the prompts to enter your email and verify the OTP.

``` bash
python otp_verification_script.py
```
### Important:
This script is intended for educational purposes and serves as a basic example. In a real-world scenario, consider using secure email services and additional security measures.

For production use, explore dedicated OTP libraries and services, such as those provided by authentication platforms.

Always handle sensitive information like email credentials securely and follow best practices for authentication and authorization.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance this script based on your specific use case and security requirements. Happy learning and coding!
