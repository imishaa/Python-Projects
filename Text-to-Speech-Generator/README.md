## Overview
The Text To Speech Generator is a Python project designed to convert the text content of web articles into spoken words. It utilizes the newspaper3k, nltk, and gtts libraries to extract and process text from web articles and convert it into speech.

## Installation

- To install the required libraries using pip, you can use the following commands. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following:

``` bash
pip install newspaper3k
pip install nltk
pip install gtts
```
Here's a brief explanation of each library:

- **newspaper3k:** This library is used for web scraping and extracting information from articles.

- **nltk:** The Natural Language Toolkit is used for natural language processing tasks. In this code, it's used for tokenization.

- **gtts (Google Text-to-Speech):** This library is used to convert text to speech.

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system before running these commands. If you don't have them installed, you can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and pip will be included.
## Note
- Ensure you have an active internet connection, as the code fetches the article from a web URL.

Feel free to use and modify this code for your own projects! If you encounter any issues, refer to the installation steps or seek additional assistance from the library documentation. Happy learning and coding!
